Read `spec.md` in the project root and implement the application. The spec is generated by the modeling tool (`bun model export-spec`) and contains stories, entities, documents, methods, permissions, relations, and change targets.

## Before you start

1. Read `spec.md` thoroughly. Understand every entity, document, method, and change target.
2. Read the reference docs for implementation patterns:
   - `.claude/docs/database.md` — SQL conventions, save/remove pattern, notify payload
   - `.claude/docs/server.md` — WebSocket protocol, preAuth config
   - `.claude/docs/client.md` — session, signals, openDoc, merge, web components
   - `.claude/docs/css.md` — styling conventions
3. Read the existing app files to understand what's already in place:
   - `init_db/01_schema.sql`, `init_db/03_functions.sql`, `server.ts`
   - `components/app-home.ts`, `components/app-login.ts`

## Implementation order

Work through these layers in order. Each layer must be complete before moving to the next.

### 1. Schema (`init_db/01_schema.sql`)

Refer to `.claude/docs/database.md` for conventions.

For each entity in the spec (skip Account — that maps to the existing `user` table):

- Create a table with the fields listed. Map types: `number` → `INT` or `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`, `string` → `TEXT`.
- Fields ending in `_id` are foreign keys — add `REFERENCES`.
- `id` is always `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`.
- `created_at` / `updated_at` use `TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()`.
- Add indexes on foreign keys used in queries.

### 2. Doc functions (`init_db/03_functions.sql`)

Refer to `.claude/docs/database.md` for the doc function pattern and notify payload shape.

For each **document** in the spec:

- Create `<doc_name>(p_user_id INT, p_<root_entity>_id INT) RETURNS JSONB`.
- Public documents: skip the permission check but still take `p_user_id` (the server always prepends it).
- Collection documents: take no entity id, return `jsonb_build_object('<name>', COALESCE(jsonb_agg(...), '[]'))`.
- Build the JSON shape by following the expansion tree:
  - **has-many**: `COALESCE((SELECT jsonb_agg(row_to_json(x)::jsonb ORDER BY x.id) FROM ...), '[]'::jsonb)`
  - **belongs-to**: subselect a single `jsonb_build_object(...)` joined via the FK
  - **shallow**: same as has-many but don't recurse into nested expansions
- For nested expansions, use lateral joins or correlated subqueries.

### 3. Mutation functions (`init_db/03_functions.sql`)

Refer to `.claude/docs/database.md` for the save/remove pattern and notify payload.

For each **method** in the spec, create a postgres function following the four-step pattern:

1. **Resolve** — look up the entity
2. **Permission** — check the permission path (if any). The `@field` syntax means: start from the entity's column. `->table[filter].target` means join through that table. Check if `p_user_id` is in the result set.
3. **Mutate** — INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE
4. **Notify** — `pg_notify('change', ...)` with targets from the **Changes** section

#### Mapping methods to function names

- Methods that create: `save_<entity>` with `p_id INT DEFAULT NULL`
- Methods that update fields (publishes): `save_<entity>` with nullable field params
- Methods that delete: `remove_<entity>`
- Custom methods: use the method name as the function name (e.g. `publish_post`)

#### Mapping change targets to notify

Each line in the **Changes** section becomes a target in the notify payload:

```
`DocName(fk)` → `path` [intermediate_fks]
```

Maps to:

```sql
jsonb_build_object(
    'doc',        'doc_name',           -- lowercase doc name
    'collection', 'path',              -- the dotted path, or null for root
    'doc_id',     v_row.fk,            -- the first FK
    'parent_ids', jsonb_build_array(v_intermediate_fk1, ...)  -- only if intermediate FKs exist
)
```

For root entity changes (no path, just `DocName(id)`), use `'collection', null`.

For collection documents, the `doc_id` is the entity's own FK to its parent scope (or omit if the collection is global).

### 4. Seed data (`init_db/04_seed.sql`)

Create realistic seed data that exercises the stories. Include at least:
- 2-3 users with different roles (matching story actors)
- Enough entities to demonstrate each document and relationship

### 5. Server config (`server.ts`)

Refer to `.claude/docs/server.md` for the `createServer` config shape.

No changes needed unless the spec has pre-auth methods beyond login/register/accept_invite.

### 6. Components

Refer to `.claude/docs/client.md` for session API, signals, openDoc/closeDoc, and the web component pattern.

For each document, create or update components:

- **`components/app-home.ts`** — the authenticated shell. Open collection documents, render lists, navigate to detail views.
- **`components/app-<name>.ts`** — detail components for non-collection documents. Use `openDoc` to subscribe, `effect` to render, `api.save_*` / `api.remove_*` to mutate.

Follow the web component pattern from `.claude/docs/client.md`:
- `connectedCallback` — set up effects, open docs
- `disconnectedCallback` — dispose effects, close docs
- Use signals for reactive state
- Use `route("/path/:id")` for parameterized views

### 7. Styles (`styles.css`)

Refer to `.claude/docs/css.md` for token conventions and component scoping.

Update CSS variables and add component styles as needed.

## Key rules

- **Never edit** `server-core.ts`, `session.ts`, `signals.ts` — these are infrastructure.
- **Never edit** `init_db/02_auth.sql` unless auth needs customization.
- The `user` table already exists — map the spec's Account entity to it.
- Every mutation function's first parameter is `p_user_id INT` — the server injects it.
- Every doc function's first parameter is `p_user_id INT` — even for public docs.
- Notify targets must exactly match what clients subscribe to via `openDoc`.
- Use `row_to_json(v_row)::jsonb` for upsert data, `jsonb_build_object('id', v_id)` for remove data.

## Presenting your plan

Before writing code, present a brief implementation plan showing:
1. Tables you'll create (with key columns)
2. Doc functions and their shapes
3. Mutation functions and their notify targets
4. Components you'll create

Ask the user to confirm before proceeding.
